------------

A quick stab at drawing GML (Graffiti Markup Language) data using Processing.js
powered by javscript, HTML5 <canvas>, and https://000000book.com

Online demo here: https://jamiedubs.com/canvasplayer
Code: https://github.com/jamiew/canvasplayer

GML data is pulled via JSONp from #000000book, an open database of GML files
https://000000book.com/data/147.json
https://000000book.com/data/147.gml
https://000000book.com/data/147


We'll be posting more GML demos, stay tuned:
